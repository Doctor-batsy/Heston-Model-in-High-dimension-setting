# Heston-Model-in-Hight-dimension-setting
This work it just another examples of solving high dimensional Partial Differential Equations.
This current project extends our previous work on solving high-dimensional Partial Differential Equations, a cornerstone in understanding complex systems in various scientific fields. For a comprehensive foundation, refer to our original study outlined in ["Neural Networks Based Algorithm for Solving High-Dimensional PDEs: Finance Case Studies"](https://github.com/Doctor-batsy/Financial-Stochastic-Model-Corrolated-Stocks-/blob/main/RESUME%20THESIS.pdf), where we initially addressed key methodologies and applications of using novel method for solving such equations that are widely used in the context of modeling option pricing and other derivatives.
